NOTE: this is individual maintenance of GUI Sir Squirrel Assistant which previously maitained by [Kryxzort](https://github.com/Kryxzort) (kudo to him!). I want to fork this and provide my own version because their is a lot of spaghetti code inside this repo, which give a cooperate nerd like me a goosebumps. If everyone support, I'm happy to contribute back to the original repo (though, only in this year 2025 as I planed to drop this game afterward due to life).
Here is Kryxzort' discord link: [Join my Discord fr](https://discord.gg/vccsv4Q4ta)

Any issue with this specific fork, please open issue

# Bug Reporting

Please let me know about any issues you face with Sir Squirrel and I will do my best to look into it.

[bug report here please](https://discord.gg/JY4v3t9cRa)

make sure that bug is not already reported, if it has then type Bump on that post and provide relevant information

please follow the format in the pinned post

# Instructions

1. Download and install `uv` (follow [this instruction](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#__tabbed_1_2)). `uv` is a new and very popular Python package manager, which will handle version control, ensure you can run script without issue.
2. Open Terminal (`cmd` or `Powershell`) and run `uv install` if this is the first time you clone this repo. Make sure your current directory is in `GuiSirSquirrelAssistant`, not `all data`.
3. Run these scripts to start the GUI:
```Powershell
cd "all data"
uv run gui_launcher.py
```
Note: why I remove all `.bat` script and `.vbs`? Well, running script without checking it yourself is a fucking bad practice from security POV and can get blocked by Windows Defense. So I want this instruction to be as transparent as possible. Please bear with it and get your hand dirty by start touching terminal. 

From there everything is intuitive though i do have explainations in the "Help" section

Enjoy and give me a star if you liked >:) keeps me motivated to see 100 stars on my repo (i have 12ğŸ˜­)
