# Instructions

download [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) make sure to click the big yellow button and not other versions since the big yellow is the only latest stable version.
make sure to select the checkbox which says "add python to path"
alternatively you can download python from the microsoft store if the web python has issues for you.

after that just run "run me if 1st time installed.bat" and let it download everything, once you see the "press any key to continue" message then you can close that window and run "Run macro.vbs" and it will launch the gui, from there everything is intuitive though i do have explainations in the "Help" section
